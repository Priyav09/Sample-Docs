						Restful Webservices 

Webservices 	-	Services exposed to internet for programmatic access 

In this client sends the Http request and web service server responds with Http response . 

Protocol 	: No Specific protocol. Rest client can send messages in any format like XML, JSON , text . 
Http Methods	: Any http methods like GET, POST can be used for exchanging data
Service definition : No specific service definition documents like WSDL in SOAP webservices are available for REST.  
	
WADL - Web Application description language - It's like WSDL that contains description of web service API.
It's usage is to generate client code that calls the service . 

* Difference between WSDL and WADL 

WSDL - Web service description language - Used as service definiton for SOAP based web service 
WSDL won't support HTTP operations other than GET and POST , hence it cannot be used with Rest as REST use all http methods. 

WADL is light weight , easier to understand and easy to write than WSDL . Further it supports all http methods . 

***********************

REST Uses the most of the concepts of HTTP 

While designing REST webservices , we should need the below 
1. Resource based URIs - every resource should be identified by the URIs defined 
2. Should choose write http methods based on the functionality unlike SOAP which uses POST method in most cases 
3. Response should send the proper http status code to indicate the status to client
4. It should contain Message headers to make client and server for format like content type
